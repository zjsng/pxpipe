/**
 * GPT history-image compression.
 *
 * The static system+tool slab is small (~30k chars); the bulk of a GPT agent
 * request is the conversation transcript, which OpenCode resends in full every
 * turn — the Responses API is driven statelessly here (no `previous_response_id`),
 * so turns 1..N-1 are re-sent as plain text on turn N. pxpipe collapses the OLD
 * closed-tool-call prefix of that transcript into 1-N PNG images and keeps the
 * recent tail as text.
 *
 * OpenAI prompt-caching is automatic and prefix-based: no `cache_control`
 * breakpoints, no 1.25× write premium, cached reads at ~0.1×. The collapse
 * boundary is snapped to a chunk grid so the history image stays byte-identical
 * across turns and keeps hitting that automatic cache (the same flap-avoidance
 * trick src/core/history.ts uses for Anthropic).
 *
 * This mirrors src/core/history.ts but operates on Responses `input` items and
 * Chat `messages` rather than Anthropic Message blocks. The two formats differ
 * enough (function_call/function_call_output vs tool_calls/tool role) that a
 * shared block type isn't worth it; instead each format is lowered to a common
 * HistoryTurn list and the planner/renderer are shared.
