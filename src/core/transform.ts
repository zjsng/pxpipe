//     extrapolated + 10% margin since we don't yet have empirical
//     measurements at wider canvases. Over-stating image cost ALSO
//     biases toward pass-through.
//
// Production bug context (2026-05-19): a request with orig_chars=169k spread
// across 88 small blocks each cost ~2,500 tokens as images = 220k tokens
// when the text would have been only 42k tokens. The flat per-block-min
// threshold (5k) was wide of the break-even point (10k) and let net-loss
// compressions through.
//
// Multi-col safety hole (closed 2026-05-19): production runs multiCol=2
// by default. The OLD flat `TOKENS_PER_IMAGE = 2500` applied at all
// numCols, so the gate believed multi-col images were ~2× cheaper than
