/**
 * Live dashboard for the Node host. Serves the main HTML page and JSON
 * polling endpoints. All "/api/*.json" endpoints recompute from disk on
 * every request — pxpipe doesn't have a query layer, but a 1.5 MB JSONL
 * streams in well under 100 ms.
 *
 * Legacy live-poll endpoints (left in place, the existing tick() loop uses
 * them):
 *
 *   GET  /, /dashboard               → main HTML page
 *   GET  /proxy-stats                → JSON aggregate over the in-mem ring
 *   GET  /proxy-recent               → JSON ring buffer of recent requests
 *   GET  /proxy-latest-png[?crop=N]  → raw PNG of the latest rendered image
 *
 * Session endpoints (read-only telemetry — no destructive operations):
 *
 *   GET  /api/sessions.json          → grouped sessions (sha8 + project + counts)
 *   GET  /api/stats.json             → full-history aggregate (formerly `pxpipe stats`)
 *
 * Metric formulas and HTML shell originally ported from the Python reference
 * implementation (deleted after live cache-rate validation hit 98.7% by tokens).
 *
 * Node-only by design. Workers host has no dashboard; use Workers Logs.
 *
 * Memory bound: ring buffer cap 50 events + a parallel ring of the last 50
 * rendered PNGs (images are never persisted to disk, so this ring is the
 * only place to view them). At a typical 75 KB PNG that's ~3-4 MB resident;
 * a process restart starts the image ring empty.
